# Checked NumPy array boundary

An explicitly imported `numpy.ndarray` can be used in Ithon signatures and
bindings. Aliases are resolved through the actual NumPy import; another module
named `np` does not acquire these rules.

The checker recognizes numeric array arithmetic, comparisons, transpose,
integer size metadata and integer shape coordinates. Index expressions are
checked, including tuple and slice components. An indexed foreign result is
unknown until its next explicit typed binding. Dtype, rank, broadcasting and
shape compatibility remain NumPy runtime checks. This is not a dependent array
type or a promise that arbitrary NumPy calls are statically verified.

The conversation-training consumer explicitly casts numerical buffers and
checks shapes, finiteness and precision configuration at its runtime boundary.
This narrow interface enables that consumer without disabling mandatory static
checking for ordinary Ithon code.
